	* Added files for building a Solaris package.
	See README.pkg.

	* Added LENSTR function to find length of character 
	string whic may contain embedded blanks. Previous approach
	of finding first blank using INDEX() fails with embeded
	blanks (common on Windows NT/2000). Could cause namespace
	pollution.
	* Port to Windows NT using MSVC++ 6.0, CVF 6.1, Freewrap
	(optional) and Exceed XDK 6.2 (optional).
	* Default install location changed from /usr/local
	to /opt/culham on Unix or C:/Program Files/Culham on
 	Windows NT/2000.
